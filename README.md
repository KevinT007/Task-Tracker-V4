What I did:

First I made a task tracker that was one of the requirements that was a great start. As I progressed I looked up more ways to do it and did four different versions of the project. The last one being the most successful. I decided to change everything again because a certain trend was going on in the presentations. All attempts use Local Storage.

Struggles:

I was trying to incorporate many ways to do something that ultimately wasted time. To fix this I found something that I understood and went with it. I also struggled with the FS portion. I couldnâ€™t figure out how to call my username and and it to the task tracker page.
